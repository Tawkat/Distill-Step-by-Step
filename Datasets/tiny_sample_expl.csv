"It's absolute nonsense how these clueless protesters in Montreal have the audacity to march against Monsanto and GMOs. Like seriously, do they really think they know better than all the scientific evidence? I mean, come on! When it comes to climate change, everyone is quick to say ""Despite all scientific evidence, people still believe..."", but magically, when it comes to GMOs, it's suddenly a question of whether they're bad or not. I can't even comprehend the stupidity! And why the focus solely on Monsanto? What about DuPont? They are just as big of players in the GMO industry, but for some reason, these protesters have conveniently forgotten about them. It's just utter hypocrisy! They should at least try to be consistent in their ignorant hatred.","Protesters In Montreal March Against Monsanto And GMO's I don't get why when it's climate change it's easy to say ""Despite all scientific evidence, people still believe..."" but with GMO it's a question.
